<h1>Microsoft Azure</h1>

<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Azure</a> is Microsoft&#39;s cloud computing environment. Some frequently used features of Azure are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Virtual Servers</li>
    <li>Offsite backup</li>
    <li>Web application hosting</li>
    <li>Cloud storage</li>
</ul>
<p>You may already be using Azure without realizing it. If you are using Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), the user account you use for that is actually an Azure Active Directory account.</p>
<p>Azure is very powerful, but it can be confusing when you are starting out. Technicality can help you navigate this process.</p>
