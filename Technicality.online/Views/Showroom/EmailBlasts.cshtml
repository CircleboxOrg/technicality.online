<h1>Email Blasts</h1>
<p>Sending email notifications from a web application via SMTP is easy. Getting your messages past spam filters is harder. </p>
<p>Understanding and configuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework" target="_blank">Sender Policy Framework</a> (SPF) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail" target="_blank">DomainKeys Identified Mail</a> (DKIM) is critical.</p>
<p>I've had good luck working with service providers like <a href="https://sendgrid.com" target="_blank">SendGrid</a> and <a href="https://elasticemail.com" target="_blank">Elastic Email</a>. It's easier to let them focus on getting mail delivered.</p>
